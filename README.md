# MSP430G2 SSD1306 OLED Display Library
This is a simple library for interfacing a MSP430G2 LaunchPad with a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED display using i2c. Much of the code for the display has been borrowed from Adafuit's wonderful SSD1306 Arduino library with modifications so that it will work with the limited RAM avalible on the MSP430G2553.
